# Analysis-of-Data-Mining-Algorithms-in-Banking-Domain
 This study analyses and estimates the best data mining algorithm for different sectors in the banking domain. Three datasets related to credit card holders, bank marketing, and bank customers from the banking domain are selected for analysis. After performing a critical analysis of all three datasets, five data mining algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) are then estimated for each of the three datasets. The study also focuses on the effects of one-hot-encoding and mean encoding techniques with K-fold regularization on the performance of the algorithms when used to encode categorical variables. The results showed that XGB(AUC ROC = 0.942, F1-score=0.909), DT(AUC ROC = 0.835, F1-score = 0.837) and SVM(AUC ROC = 0.733, F1-score = 0.541) were the best performing models for the datasets related to credit card holders, bank marketing and bank customers respectively.
